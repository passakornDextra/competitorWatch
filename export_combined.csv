In 1920 a young engineer called Julius Schroeder formed a new company in Dortmund called ""Maschinenfabrik
Julius Schroeder G.m.b.H.""supported by his brother Paul, a successful steel merchant. Julius Schroeder had previously worked at the Dortmunder Union steel mill and had helped develop the innovative Larssen steel sheet pile profiles (the first steel sheet piles rolled in one piece with an interlock). With the knowledge gained he set about his dream of running his own manufacturing company and in 1921, acquired the production plant for the manufacture of glass blowing machines from the company ""Klempt"" in Dortmund-Brackel. Julius quickly adapted the machines to the production and repair of buffers and springs for the Reichsbahn (German State Railway) and then expanded to supplying picking irons for the mining industry. From 1924, the factory then specialized in the manufacture of heavy turnbuckles for 'ankers' which became the beginnings of Anker Schroeder as we know it today.
in 1930 the global economic crisis proved tough for Julius and Paul and Paul Schroeder decided to resign and pursue other activities. Julius Schroeder persevered and in order to save the company from bankruptcy converted the limited company into a partnership therefore becoming personally liable for any debts. Over the next decade the company was gradually turned around with the dedication of Julius Schroeder.",Anker Schroeder,,

Stephan joined Anker Schroeder ASDO GmbH in 2010 as an apprentice welder completing a technical baccalaureate. His grades and commitment allowed him to progress further to study part time for a degree in mechanical engineering whilst continuing his in-house training at ASDO, during which time he became capable in all aspects of production at ASDO.
But not content with 'just' a BSc Stephan embarked on the challenge of a MSc with the dissertation project of devising CAD/CAM modelling techniques for the stamping of brand images onto large forgings allowing Anker Schroeder to further develop products with minimal tooling and sample costs.
Stephan's hard work has paid off and he was awarded a level '1' for his MSc, the highest band possible.
Well done Stephan and we look forward to much more development!
